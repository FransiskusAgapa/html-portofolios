<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Frans and I am a web developer, I love to making website from
  scratch, which might sound painful for some poeople but for me the process is
  what excites me the most and the result is like like a bonus point for me!
</p>

<p>
  I love traveling and taking picture while doing it, I used to be confused
  where to put all photo that I have taken becuase I want people to see them
  since I know I take good pictures and I am not a new in the world of
  photography.
</p>

<p>
  I also want to visit every cafe in Seattle and take picture of their menu and
  post it on my website as a reference for you to review if you would be
  interested in visiting some of the cafe in Seattle
